# Model-of-EQIL-distribution-area
This project aims to create a simulation model for the earthquake-induced landslide (EQIL) area near Zagreb, Croatia to predict the extent (or reach) of the possible landslide (EQIL) triggered by Medvednica mountainâ€™s orogeny.

Landslides are mass movements of soil and rocks along a slope. Landslides occur when the
shear strength of the hillside material decreases due to an increase in the shear stress of the
slope, or due to processes of change in the natural ecosystem caused by anthropogenic
activities (Moresi et al., 2020). Sometimes, landslides can be caused by human activities, or
more so, they can modify the threshold of occurrence of landslides by accelerating the
dynamics of natural processes (Sidle & Bogaard, 2016). They can cause severe damage, and
while most of them occur slowly over time, the most destructive ones happen suddenly after
being triggered by an event such as earthquakes or heavy rainfall (Conners, 2019).
Earthquake-induced landslides (EQIL) are the most destructive secondary natural hazards
associated with earthquakes and are also the focus of this paper (Jibson, 2007).

This research presents a study that aims to estimate earthquake-induced landslide distribution
area and to scrutinize its area-wise morphological characteristics. The results show the
estimates for the Zagreb/Zagorje region in Croatia. In this region, the Medvednica mountain
orogeny triggers seismic events which may potentially lead to earthquake-induced landslides.
This research raises the question: What is the EQIL distribution area in the Zagreb/Zagorje
(Croatia) neighborhood and what is specific for it in terms of terrain characteristics? To
answer it, we estimate the distribution area of an EQIL induced landslide in the region of
Zagreb, Croatia, and study its morphological characteristics.

This kind of research is relevant in terms of avoiding the possible effects of such natural
disasters. Those effects can include road crashes and debris falling which may cause deaths
or destroy properties. Governments and insurers can benefit from estimating
earthquake-induced landslide (EQIL) distribution areas by including their risk while
developing the infrastructure or selling insurance. Furthermore, residents should also know
about the possible dangers of living in such areas.
